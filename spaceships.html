        <p>Falcon 9 is a partially reusable medium-lift launch vehicle that can carry cargo and crew into Earth orbit, designed, manufactured and launched by American aerospace company SpaceX. It can also be used as an expendable heavy-lift launch vehicle. The first Falcon 9 launch was in June 2010. The first Falcon 9 ISS commercial resupply mission to the ISS launched on 8 October 2012.[15] In 2020 it became the first commercial rocket to ever launch humans to orbit and is currently the only such vehicle capable of doing so.[16] It is the only U.S. rocket currently certified for transporting humans to the International Space Station.[17][18][19] In 2020, it became the U.S. rocket with the most launches in history and with the best safety record, having suffered just one flight failure.</p>
